# Run this script in the 'Camera Uploads' folder
# of your Dropbox and it will sort through all
# of your pictures and place them into directories
# based on the year they were taken
#
# As of right now, this script only works with
# pictures taken by iOS and Android devices because it is
# dependent on their naming conventions of
# YEAR-MONTH-DAY.[file_extension]
# i.e 2010-01-23.png
#
# This script currently searches for
# .jpg, .png, .mov, .gif, and .mp4 files, but other file
# types can be supported by adding them to the list
# on line 41

# Accept start year as first argument, go through the current year
